        A growing Berkeley tutoring startup that I worked on in Fall 2013.
        As Lead Engineer, I developed the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) backend
        for the site. Some tools I used include [Heroku](http://heroku.com/), 
        [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/), and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).
        I played a significant role in front-end development as well, working on
        responsive design and form validation. Uguru is now part of the
        [500 Startups](http://500.co/ugurume) accelerator.

        My hack for Camp Hackathona at Facebook during Summer 2013. The idea 
        is simple: bump phones with another person and be thrown to their Facebook.
        We made this before Apple added NFC to their phones, so instead we use
        accelerometers to determine a "bump", and then MongoDB's geospatial
        queries to determine which two phones bumped. We built both an HTML5 app and a
        standalone iOS application.

        An Android application for working with resistor values. 
        It's simple, small, and user-friendly -- and open source! This was my first mobile project, as
        well as my first Java project. I had zero experience with either going into it.
        The app is published to the Google Play Store.
